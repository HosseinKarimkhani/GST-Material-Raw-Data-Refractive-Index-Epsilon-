In the drive toward efficient neuromorphic computing, photonic technologies offer promising solutions for implementing neural functionalities. Here we demonstrate the first all-optical double micro-ring resonator incorporating Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) as a phase-change material to realize precise nonlinear activation functions (NLAF). Our device architecture achieves switching speeds of 0.5 ns through a novel approach to GST integration, where angular positioning of GST segments within the rings enables unprecedented control over optical transmission characteristics. Through systematic investigation of sixteen distinct phase configurations, we identify optimal GST positioning (180◦ in the first ring, 90◦ in the second) that achieves ultra-narrow band transmission with 0.47 nm full width at half maximum. Operating at significantly lower temperatures (≈ 100◦C) than conventional GST implementations, our device maintains high contrast ratios with transmission coefficient modulation from near-zero to 0.85 across a 4 nm spectral window. The dual-ring architecture enables independent optimization of spectral selectivity and switching contrast - a capability previously unattainable in single-ring designs. These results demonstrate a viable pathway toward efficient neuromorphic photonic systems that can operate at speeds relevant for practical computing applications while maintaining the precision required for neural processing.
